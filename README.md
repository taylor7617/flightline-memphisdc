# FlightLine — Memphis DC

> **Memphis DC | Capital of NETTOPIA**  
> Every ZIP = Runway · Every Scan = Proof · Every Payment = Public.

FlightLine — Memphis DC is the **capital node of NETTOPIA** and the first
FlightLine city grid.

This repo powers the public site:

- 🌐 **Live site:** https://taylor7617.github.io/flightline-memphisdc/
- 🔗 **Support & ecosystem:** https://linktr.ee/QRF_Code_Veterans  

It serves as a **digital airport + motion-proof ledger** for cities, brands,
and campaigns:

- DSX Packs = **fuel** (credits for motion)
- Gates = **leased corridors** (storefront → neighborhood → city → region)
- Proof Stack = **evidence-grade logs** (scan, movement, custody)
- FlightLine P.C. Meetings = **Production & Creation cockpit** for mapping lanes

---

## What lives on the Memphis DC site

The public page is a **live departures board** for the Memphis DC grid:

### 1. Hero · Memphis DC Capital Grid

- Introduces **FlightLine Memphis DC** as the capital node of NETTOPIA  
- Frames the grid as **digital real estate + airport lanes**  
- Sets the core covenant:

  > Every ZIP = Runway  
  > Every Scan = Proof  
  > Every Payment = Public.

### 2. FlightLine Motion Court

- “Every move is evidence.”  
- Shows how **motion logs, custody lanes, and scan trails** can be treated
  like **court-grade exhibits**.
- DSX Packs, Gates, and BTC routes roll up into the **Flight Papers**.

### 3. Proof Stack (3 Layers)

The **Proof Stack** is the backbone:

1. **Every Scan = Proof**  
   - Angel’s Kitchen / front-gate scans  
   - Every QR scan is a **time-stamped event** on the DSX ledger

2. **The Proof Is in the Movement**  
   - Routes, leases, and lanes across cities / towers  
   - Expansion is always tied to **actual motion**, not just a slide deck

3. **Pillar 3 · Unbroken Custody**  
   - From **Lightning Node Family Trust** to **BTC Traveler**  
   - Every handoff, who held what, when, and where = **traceable chain**

### 4. DSX Packs · DiGi Snax PACK

DSX Packs act as **credits** that fund motion on the grid.

- DSX 01 → Starter · first spark  
- DSX 04 → City Runner · one city grid  
- DSX 10 → Googol · mega-motion network takeover  

Each pack connects to **potential lanes, gates, and Proof Stack logs**.

### 5. Gates Board · G1–G17

The **Gates Board** is a departures screen for corridors:

- G1 → Storefront Lane  
- G3 → City Grid Gate (reserved for Memphis DC)  
- G8 → BTC Travel Gate (Code of D.A.V.I.D. / B10 Towers)  
- G11–G17 → reserved expansion lanes (future towers, continents, alliances)

Gates are **leased positions** that can be wired into the Proof Stack and DSX.

### 6. FlightLine P.C. Meeting

P.C. = **Production & Creation**

- 30-minute cockpit session via **Calendly**  
- Define: lanes, DSX Packs, BTC travel, Proof Stack wiring  
- Align a city, brand, or campaign with the Memphis DC grid

### 7. Contact & Ops

- **Linktree:** QRF_Code_Veterans  
- **Calendly:** FlightLine HQ  
- Notes that **all calls, scans, and lanes** can be logged as Flight Papers.
