## What is the FlightLine?

FlightLine is a public, QR-powered **proof & access line** for real places—blocks, schools, arenas, storefronts. Scan a code at a **Gate** to check in, find the right door, pay or get help, and leave a trail the whole community can verify.

**Every ZIP = Runway. Every Scan = Proof. Every Payment = Public.**

### Why it clicks
- *Like an airport:* clear signage, Gates, and a “you are here → you go there” flow.
- *Like a modern brokerage:* clean listings (cards), maps, and transparent activity.

### Who it’s for
- **Residents & guests:** no app. Scan to prove presence, see schedules, maps, and offers.
- **Local orgs & venues:** publish Gates, route actions, get public receipts.
- **Funders & partners:** see live activity and payment proofs before you invest.

### What you can do today
- Browse **[Gates]({{ '/gates/' | relative_url }})** → pick a lane (HQ, Esports, Classroom, Store…)
- Tap **Support** (top-right) to fund operations via Linktree
- Open maps from a Gate card to get there

### How it works (3 steps)
1. **Scan** the QR posted at a Gate.  
2. **xPortal** routes your action (check-in, payment, form) to the right service.  
3. A **public proof** is written so anyone can confirm “it happened.”

### Trust & privacy
- No app install, no account required to scan.
- Proofs show *what/when/where*—not your private data.
- Financial flows publish receipts so the public can audit support.
